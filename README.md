## 🧩 Project Overview
This project analyzes **Zara’s 2024–2025 sales data** to understand and predict product sales volume based on pricing, seasonality, promotion, material, and brand.  
The dataset was cleaned, explored, and modeled using Python in **Jupyter Notebook**.  

The goal was to:
- Perform end-to-end **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Build **machine learning models** (Linear Regression & Decision Tree)
- Evaluate performance using **R² and RMSE metrics**
- Visualize predictions and gain business insights

## 🧹 Data Preparation & Cleaning
1. **Loaded dataset** (`.xlsx`) using `pandas.read_excel()`
2. **Checked missing values** — found a few in `name` and `description`
   - Filled with `"Unknown Product"` or `"No description available"`
3. **Removed outliers** in price using IQR (Interquartile Range)
4. **Converted categorical variables** using `pd.get_dummies()`
5. **Final dataset shape:** ~19,600 rows × 16 features

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed **price distribution** using boxplots and histograms
- Compared **sales volume vs product category**
- Explored **seasonal patterns** and **promotion effects**
- Detected correlations between numeric variables

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

### 1️⃣ Linear Regression
- R² Score: **0.9008**  
- RMSE: **93.16**

✅ Captured clear linear relationships between price, promotion, and sales.  
Performed best overall — accurate and stable.

### 2️⃣ Decision Tree Regressor
- R² Score: **0.8967**

✅ Captured non-linear relationships  
Slightly lower performance but interpretable.

## 💡 Insights & Interpretation
- **Price** and **Promotion** were the strongest predictors of sales.
- **Seasonality** and **Material** also affected demand patterns.
- Zara’s sales patterns are **largely linear**, meaning traditional models like Linear Regression work very well.
- Data is **predictable and clean**, indicating consistent business operations.

---

## 🏁 Conclusion
- **Best Model:** Linear Regression (R² = 0.90)
- **Business Insight:** Zara can use this model to forecast sales, optimize pricing, and plan promotions.
- **Next Step:** Extend with Random Forest or Gradient Boosting for deeper prediction capabilities.
